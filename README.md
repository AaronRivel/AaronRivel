👋 Hi, I’m @AaronRivel. I'm currently a university student in Industrial Electronic Engineering. I'm new to GitHub and very excited to start working and learning within this community.

👀 I’m interested in robotics and electronics, and I look forward to sharing my projects and learning from others.

🌱 I’m currently learning ROS (Robot Operating System) and robotics, with a focus on programming languages like Python and C++. I have a strong interest in object-oriented programming (OOP), control systems, and modeling. My current and first project is designing a quadruped robot with ROS using Dynamixel motors from Robotis.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with robotic communities and get used to collaborative work.
